# Codechef Event Bot  
  
### Python script for automated directory creation  
  
    
Uses the 'beautiful soup' and 'requests' modules to extract problem codes from the URL and 'subprocess', 'os' and 'sys' module to create corresponding directories and files. **The script is environment-specific.**    
  
   
I have saved the python file in my home directory to save myself the efforts of typing the entire directory path.  

For my system environment, the required command is - **python3 codechef_env.py *Event URL*.**
